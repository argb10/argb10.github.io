Projects!

Ou yeah, let's go with the list:

- [Undertale Prisma!](https://github.com/argb10/UndertalePrisma). Not a fan of Undertale, but I'm a fan of programming games :=)

- Security inside a kubernetes helm? Yeah baby, and for a big company! Check [here](https://github.com/argb10/graphdb-helm)

- Random bullshit go! HTB, OverTheWire, you name it! And also with horrible writeup!
C'mon, you can find pretty writeups everywhere, but horrible one? only [here](https://github.com/argb10/CyberSec)!

- A couple of custom CTFs... Because, why not:
